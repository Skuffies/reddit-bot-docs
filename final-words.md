# Final Words

If you still face issues, try reinstalling Python and the bot and perform everything mentioned here again. You can also try looking for your error on the troubleshooting page or in the panic section (if there is one). If you still didn't manage to solve your error, raise an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/elebumm/RedditVideoMakerBot/issues) or get onto the [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/5uw4eCQf6Z) and ask the community for some help.

Enjoy and have fun with the bot!
